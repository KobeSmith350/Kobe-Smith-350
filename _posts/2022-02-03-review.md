Civil War Washington is a digital humanities project that explores Washington D.C, the nation’s capital during a period of war through different lenses. It looks at the social, political, cultural and medical climate that was influenced heavily by the Civil War. Created by Susan Lawrence, Elizabeth Lorang, Kenneth Price, and Kenneth Winkle, this project uses interactive mapping, images, essays, and other forms of data visualizations to give people a sense of what life was like during this time period. The digital resources utilized on this project paint the descriptive picture of the good and bad impact war had on Washington D.C.

In the medical case section, the files describing the injuries of people were very detailed and graphic, however the website says that there are images of such medical injuries and I did not find any. It would be helpful to add an image because reading medical terms without a visual is confusing to someone who does not have medical experience as they can not picture what is going on. The newspaper section has scanned documents of the original copies, but there is no transcribed version of them. Trying to read off of a scanned document on this website is hard. They have a great example of how it should be in the text section under petitions, where it has a scanned image of the actual petitions along with the image transcribed so that you can read it.

The visual works page is very short but concise. As of right now, it contains portraits of people and places depicting life in war time Washington. Under each picture, it has a small description of what you are looking at like that of a museum. This page still has work to do, but I am excited for what’s in store as they plan on making the descriptions more detailed and adding more photographs, lithographs and drawings. Also, this project is accessible on a mobile device such as a phone and easy to use. The documents that are loaded to the site can be saved to a pdf file for you to access at a later time so that you do not have to go to the site everytime you want to read.

One thing that was executed well on this project was the interactive map. It has a tutorial that introduces simple functions for inexperienced users as well as more technical aspects for serious researchers on this topic. The map interface uses current and historical digitized views on different hospitals, freedmen’s villages, and theaters that help users understand the importance of map making during the war as well as learning more about districts in Washington D.C. When browsing, clicking on an item from the map will bring up a small description of it along with other pertinent data. Some of the items even have an additional link that will take you to the Data section of the site with more information on the topic.

Overall, the site is pretty easy to navigate. I would recommend putting in visuals that say “click here” or etc to make it easier where to go next after reading huge chunks of information. This project is very user friendly and has plenty of data for casual browsers as well as scholars who want to further their research. Published by the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Civil War Washington sheds light on a city that did not get much coverage during the Civil War as people mainly focused their learning on the North and the South instead of Washington D.C. itself.
