# Final Reflection

I am a finance major so anytime I hear writing or English, I immediately get disengaged. I came in taking this course for the writing intensive credit and having no idea what DH is, however, after taking this course I have developed my own idea of it. Digital humanities is a discipline that combines technology with humanities for the analysis of applications to the real world. My definition at first was very vague but after the many readings and interesting class discussions I have a better understanding of this field. The hardest part of it all was figuring out how to classify certain projects as DH or not. DH projects will have an application to the real world as well as interactive features to the site that further educate the user. DH is also collaborative in which many of the projects have multiple creators. To be quite honest, Professor Stover’s passion for this course seeped into my attitude about it, making me more engaged in class discussions as well as writing about it.

The readings were a great supplement to understanding the course material. The length of them was not too long which kept me engaged throughout considering this was a topic I have no knowledge in. Reading and then tweeting about it furthered the discussion. It allowed for the class to converse about the different information they read and develop meaningful connections to other ideas that they may not have thought of. For me personally, it was an avenue to analyze what I just read in a concise manner so that I could actually digest what I learned instead of it going right out my brain. One reading in particular that caught my eye was the “Text Scanning Patterns: Eyetracking Evidence” article. It discussed the four different patterns that people use to scan information on websites. I had never thought this was a topic that could be researched. This was helpful to my writing abilities in this class because I could construct my text in a way that would keep readers engaged the whole time. Most of the readings were interesting but this one stood out to me as I could directly correlate it to my improvement as a writer. 

The assignment I most enjoyed was the review of a DH project. I reviewed Civil War Washington, a site that examines the cultural, political, and societal aspects of life in the capital during the Civil War. It had a lot of information up there like manuscripts, visual works, newspapers, medical cases, and an interactive map that was user friendly. This activity allowed me to analyze the good and bad while understanding the complexities of what makes a project DH. I liked most of the assignments in this class but the TEI coding was a struggle. Although Professor Stover helped break it down on the course website, I still had a challenging time identifying the different code needed for small things in the text like Em-dashes, inscriptions, or quotes. It was not a hard assignment, just something I was not interested in. Also, it was difficult elaborating on the process in the blog post since it was not much to the assignment other than coding. Overall, the assignments were a great way to open my mind to different aspects of DH that broke down a complex topic into something I could understand for the most part. The blog posts helped me reflect on the assignments and what I got out of it as well as feedback for Professor Stover.

I think I have grown a lot as a writer, however my habits as a student and reader have not changed much. There are many different writing assignments done in the class that have contributed to this growth such as blog posts, critiquing a DH project, and the final grant. Each has had different objectives that pushed me to go outside of my comfort zone. The biggest challenge was learning how to be concise with my writing, getting my point across in as few words possible. Through the many peer reviews and help from professor Stover, I was able to navigate that challenge and ultimately do well in the course. Also, the weekly twitter posts helped a lot too. Being able to reflect on what I read into a short statement translates well into the bigger writing assignments. Even though my major is not writing intensive, I have enjoyed this course and the  literary advice I received throughout the semester will stay with me forever.
