I am a **junior** at Christopher Newport University majoring in Finance. I also play soccer here for the Men’s team. [Link to my profile](https://www.cnusports.com/sports/mens-soccer/roster/kobe-smith/16869) 
My pronouns are He/Him. Even though I am taking this course to fulfill the Writing Intensive requirement, I am still interested in learning more about Digital Humanities and excited to develop my writing skills for my future profession. I am so happy this class was still open because I dropped another class halfway through the first day for this. 

Due to Covid, I have an extra year of eligibility for soccer which will allow me to play and pursue my Masters in Financial Analysis program at CNU. After that year, I will enter the job market searching for either a position pertaining to my degree or coaching since that is another interest of mine. It will be hard giving up soccer since I have been playing or been around the sport since I was five so hopefully I could find a balance between both career paths. Empowering people is what motivates me, so my dream is to become successful through the connections I build with others.

I have no summer intern experience relating to finance but I coach youth camps over the summers. This past summer, I spent time in Ashburn, Virginia coaching for Coerver. I also volunteer my time during the semester coaching for my old travel team Virginia Legacy located in Williamsburg. [Link to travel team](http://www.valegacysoccer.com).  Outside of the classroom, I play soccer for CNU which takes up most of my time, however I am looking to get involved with CeeFund, an investing club on campus. This upcoming summer I am in pursuit of a financial consulting internship, so we’ll see how it goes. **Fingers crossed**. 

I was born and raised in Hampton, Virginia, so I’ve been a local guy my whole life. Being that I have no siblings, it’s pretty quiet around the house except for my dog, Gizmo who barks a lot. In my free time, I love to play _Call of Duty_, workout, and spend time with my best friend Brendan. Crazy thing is, we literally did not know each other coming into freshman year so him and I becoming so close is awesome. One thing you’ll learn about me is that I love spending time with family and friends. Life is too short, so cherishing the moments and living in the present is something I live by everyday.
